<h2> Desctription:</h2>

<p id="description">Due to the increasing diversification of customer profiles and the fact that customers cannot fit into a single mold there is a growing need for personalized solutions. In this project we aim to classify customers based on RFM analysis to better understand them. Additionally we intend to analyze our existing market basket data to generate personalized campaigns tailored to each customer segment and use GPS sensors to deliver these campaigns to customer groups approaching our store. The ultimate goal is to enhance customer satisfaction by providing unique experiences to each individual customer.</p>
